name: E2E Tests on Preview Deployment

# Purpose: Run E2E tests against Vercel preview deployments to validate PRs
# Trigger: Manual only (workflow_dispatch) - automatic triggers disabled
#
# NOTE: This workflow is DISABLED for automatic runs because:
# - Convex free tier doesn't support multiple deployments (see ADR-003)
# - Preview deployments would connect to production Convex backend (unsafe)
# - E2E tests should be run locally before merging: npm run test:e2e
#
# To re-enable when upgrading to Convex Pro tier:
# 1. Set up separate Convex deployment for previews
# 2. Configure Vercel preview environment variables
# 3. Uncomment the pull_request trigger below

on:
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger only
  # pull_request:     # DISABLED - see ADR-003 for deployment strategy
  #   branches: [main, develop]
  #   types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
