# So Quotable - Project Brief

## Overview

Allows users to generate quotes on top of images of the source of the quote. Quotes should have a verified, attributed source.

## Problem

People engaged in online discussions often know the perfect quote to support their point, but face significant friction in finding or creating a compelling quote image in the moment. Google Image searches yield unreliable results, and existing meme generators focus on joke templates rather than verified, attributed quotes. This friction typically leads to either abandoning the quote entirely or posting text without the visual impact of an image. Beyond the immediate inconvenience, there's a larger credibility concern: the internet is flooded with misattributed and fabricated quotes, making it difficult to share authentic, verified quotations that strengthen arguments rather than undermine credibility through misinformation.

## Solution

So Quotable provides a curated database approach to quote verification and image generation. The platform maintains interconnected databases of famous people, their verified quotes, and associated images. Users can search for a specific person or quote, browse verified quotations linked to that person, and select from a collection of images. Once they've found the right quote-person-image combination, they can customize the presentation with an overlay editor that allows them to control text placement, font selection, size, and other styling options. This creates a streamlined workflow from "I need this quote" to "I have a shareable image" in seconds rather than minutes, all while ensuring the quote is actually attributed to the correct person through database curation rather than unreliable internet scraping.

## Target Audience

**Primary Users**: People actively engaged in online discussions (forums, social media, comment sections) who want to support their arguments with credible, verified quotes presented in a visually compelling format. These users value authenticity and are frustrated by the prevalence of misattributed quotes online. They're willing to take a few extra seconds to find the right verified quote rather than risk undermining their credibility with fake or misattributed content.

**User Characteristics**:
- Active participants in online discourse
- Value credibility and factual accuracy
- Prefer visual impact over plain text
- Currently frustrated with existing quote-finding tools

## Key Features

1. **Person & Quote Search**: Search by person name or quote text to quickly find relevant verified quotations
2. **Curated Quote Database**: Verified database of famous people, their authentic quotes, and source attribution to prevent misinformation
3. **Image Library**: Collection of images associated with each person for visual pairing with quotes
4. **Quote Overlay Editor**: Customization tools for text placement, font selection, sizing, and styling to create the perfect visual presentation
5. **Quick Export/Share**: Generate and download shareable images optimized for social media and online discussions

## Success Metrics

As a passion project, success is measured by practical validation rather than specific growth targets:

- **Personal Use**: The creator actively uses So Quotable in their own online discussions instead of falling back to Google Image searches
- **Early Validation**: A handful of other users find the tool valuable enough to use regularly, demonstrating the concept solves a real problem
- **Database Quality**: The curated quote database maintains high accuracy with proper source attribution, proving the verification approach works
- **Technical Achievement**: Successfully building a functional demo that demonstrates the core workflow (search → select → customize → export)
- **Learning Goal**: Gaining hands-on experience with the chosen tech stack and project structure

The primary metric is simply: "Does this solve the problem I originally had?" If the answer is yes, the project succeeds.
