Project-wide technical documentation and decisions.

## Contents

This directory will contain:

- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - Key technical decisions
- **System Architecture** - High-level system design
- **API Documentation** - API contracts and specifications

## Creating ADRs

When making significant technical decisions, document them:

```bash
/docs "create ADR for choosing database technology"
```

ADRs help future developers understand why decisions were made.
