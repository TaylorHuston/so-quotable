# PM Guidelines

**Referenced by Commands:** `/epic` for epic/issue creation patterns

## Quick Reference

This guideline defines patterns for creating and managing epics and issues. Commands like `/epic` and `/plan` read these configurations to ensure consistent project management structure.

## Epic Management

### Epic Structure

Epics are feature-level initiatives that group related tasks and bugs. They represent significant capabilities or product areas.

**File Location:** `pm/epics/EPIC-###-<kebab-case-name>.md`

**Standard Format:**
```yaml
---
epic_number: EPIC-###
status: planning
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# EPIC-###: Name

## Description
[Epic goal and scope - what capability are we building?]

## Definition of Done
[Concrete criteria that signal epic completion]
[Can be prose or checklist based on complexity]

## Dependencies
- ADR-###: [Decision name]
- EPIC-###: [Other epic dependency]
- External: [External dependencies]

## Tasks
- [ ] TASK-###: [Task name]
- [ ] TASK-###: [Task name]
- [ ] BUG-###: [Bug name]
```

### Epic Naming Conventions

**Epic Files:**
- Pattern: `EPIC-###-<kebab-case-name>.md`
- Examples:
  - `EPIC-001-user-authentication.md`
  - `EPIC-002-payment-processing.md`
  - `EPIC-003-admin-dashboard.md`

**Naming Rules:**
- Sequential numbering starting from 001
- Kebab-case for multi-word names
- Descriptive but concise (3-5 words ideal)
- Focus on capability, not implementation

### Epic Breakdown Guidelines

**Recommended Epic Size: 2-8 tasks**

**Why this range:**
- **Too small (1 task):** Acceptable for significant features, but consider if it's really an epic
- **Sweet spot (2-8 tasks):** Focused, deliverable in 1-3 iterations
- **Too large (10+ tasks):** Consider decomposing into multiple epics

**Epic Decomposition Triggers:**
- More than 10 tasks
- Tasks span multiple domains with no shared context
- Epic takes more than 3 sprints/iterations
- Definition of Done is vague or overly broad

**How to Decompose:**
```
Original: EPIC-001 "E-commerce Platform" (25 tasks)
  ↓
Decomposed:
- EPIC-001: "Product Catalog" (5 tasks)
- EPIC-002: "Shopping Cart" (4 tasks)
- EPIC-003: "Checkout Flow" (6 tasks)
- EPIC-004: "Order Management" (5 tasks)
- EPIC-005: "Admin Panel" (5 tasks)
```

### Definition of Done Patterns

**Format Choice: Prose vs Checklist**

**Use Prose** when criteria are conceptual:
```markdown
## Definition of Done
Users can create accounts, log in securely with email/password or Google OAuth, reset forgotten passwords via email, and manage their profile information. The system achieves 95%+ test coverage and passes security audit.
```

**Use Checklist** when criteria are concrete:
```markdown
## Definition of Done
- [ ] Users can register with email/password
- [ ] Users can log in with Google OAuth
- [ ] Password reset via email works end-to-end
- [ ] Profile management (update email, password)
- [ ] 95%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] Security audit passed with no critical findings
```

**Best Practice:** Choose format that makes completion criteria clearest for your team.

## Issue Management

### Issue Types

Standard types provided by default (see machine-readable config above):

**TASK** - Implementation work
- New features, enhancements, refactoring
- Template: `pm/templates/task.md`
- File: `pm/issues/TASK-###-name/TASK.md`

**BUG** - Defects and fixes
- Bugs, regressions, incorrect behavior
- Template: `pm/templates/bug.md`
- File: `pm/issues/BUG-###-name/BUG.md`

### Custom Issue Types

Teams can add custom types by:
1. Creating template: `pm/templates/[type].md`
2. Updating machine-readable config above
3. Using pattern: `[TYPE]-###-name/[TYPE].md`

**Common Custom Types:**
- **SPIKE** - Research, investigation, proof of concept
- **RFC** - Request for Comments, design proposals
- **EXPERIMENT** - Time-boxed experiments
- **DEBT** - Technical debt remediation

### Issue Naming Conventions

**Issue Directories:**
- Pattern: `[TYPE]-###-<kebab-case-name>/`
- Examples:
  - `TASK-001-user-registration/`
  - `BUG-003-session-timeout/`
  - `SPIKE-002-caching-strategy/`

**Naming Rules:**
- Sequential numbering per type (TASK-001, TASK-002, BUG-001, BUG-002)
- Global numbering across entire project (not per-epic)
- Kebab-case for multi-word names
- Descriptive (appears in file paths and git branches)

### Issue Directory Structure

Each issue gets a directory containing multiple files:

```
pm/issues/TASK-001-user-registration/
├── TASK.md        # Definition, acceptance criteria, plan (REQUIRED)
├── PLAN.md        # Implementation phases (created by /plan)
├── WORKLOG.md     # Work history (auto-created by /implement)
└── RESEARCH.md    # Technical deep dives (optional)
```

**File Purposes:**
- **[TYPE].md** - WHAT to do (requirements, acceptance criteria)
- **PLAN.md** - HOW to do it (phase breakdown, approach)
- **WORKLOG.md** - WHAT was done (narrative history, lessons)
- **RESEARCH.md** - WHY decisions were made (technical analysis)

**File Lifecycle:**
1. `/epic` or manual creation → Creates `[TYPE].md`
2. `/plan TASK-###` → Creates `PLAN.md`
3. `/implement TASK-### 1.1` → Creates/updates `WORKLOG.md`
4. Complex decisions → Manually create `RESEARCH.md`

## Epic Creation Workflow

**Pattern Used by `/epic` Command**

### 1. Conversational Creation

The `/epic` command conducts natural conversation to gather:
- Epic name (extracted or asked)
- Description (what capability are we building)
- Definition of Done (completion criteria)
- Dependencies (ADRs, other epics, external factors)

**Philosophy:** Natural on surface, structured underneath.

### 2. Epic Number Assignment

**Logic:**
1. Scan `pm/epics/` directory
2. Find highest EPIC-### number
3. Increment by 1
4. Assign to new epic

**Example:**
```
Existing: EPIC-001, EPIC-002, EPIC-004 (EPIC-003 deleted)
Next: EPIC-005 (continues sequence, doesn't fill gaps)
```

### 3. Name Conversion

User input: "User Authentication System"
↓ Convert to kebab-case
File name: `EPIC-005-user-authentication-system.md`

### 4. Task Suggestion Strategy

**After epic creation, optionally suggest initial tasks:**

**Analysis Approach:**
1. Parse epic description for key features
2. Identify foundational components (database, auth, core logic)
3. Suggest 2-3 foundational tasks
4. User selects, customizes, or describes own

**Example:**
```
Epic: "User Authentication System"
Description: "Login, registration, password reset, Google OAuth"

Suggested Tasks:
1. TASK-###: User Registration (core capability)
2. TASK-###: Login Flow (core capability)
3. TASK-###: Database Schema for Users (foundational)

User can:
- Accept all
- Select specific ones
- Describe custom task
- Skip task creation
```

**Interactive Loop:**
```
AI: "Create these tasks? (yes/all/custom/stop)"
User: "custom"
AI: "Describe the task you want to create..."
User: "Add password strength validation"
AI: "Creating TASK-###..."
AI: "Create another? (yes/no)"
```

## Issue Creation Workflow

**Pattern Used During Epic Task Creation**

### 1. Issue Number Assignment

**Logic (per issue type):**
1. Scan `pm/issues/` for all `[TYPE]-###-*` directories
2. Find highest number for this type
3. Increment by 1
4. Assign to new issue

**Important:** Numbering is GLOBAL per type, not per-epic.

**Example:**
```
Existing issues:
- TASK-001 (epic: EPIC-001)
- TASK-002 (epic: EPIC-001)
- TASK-003 (epic: EPIC-002)

Creating task for EPIC-003:
Next: TASK-004 (continues global sequence)
```

### 2. Issue Type Detection

**For bugs:** Always use BUG-### prefix
**For tasks:** Default to TASK-### prefix
**For custom:** Use custom prefix (SPIKE-###, RFC-###, etc.)

**Detection from conversation:**
- Keywords "bug", "fix", "broken", "regression" → BUG
- Keywords "feature", "add", "implement" → TASK
- Explicit type in request → Use that type

### 3. Template-Driven Creation

**Process:**
1. Determine issue type (TASK, BUG, etc.)
2. Read corresponding template (`pm/templates/[type].md`)
3. Parse template for required sections
4. Gather details conversationally
5. Create `pm/issues/[TYPE]-###-name/[TYPE].md` following template

**Template Sections (from templates):**
- YAML frontmatter (metadata)
- Description
- Acceptance Criteria
- Technical Notes (optional)
- NO Plan section (added later by `/plan`)

### 4. Epic Linkage

**Frontmatter Reference:**
```yaml
---
issue_number: TASK-###
type: task
epic: EPIC-001        # Links issue to epic
status: todo
created: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

**Epic Update:**
```markdown
## Tasks
- [ ] TASK-001: User Registration
- [ ] TASK-002: Login Flow
- [ ] TASK-003: Password Reset  ← Added to epic file
```

**Bidirectional References:**
- Issue → Epic (via frontmatter `epic:` field)
- Epic → Issues (via Tasks section checkboxes)

## Jira Integration Patterns

**When Jira is Enabled** (`CLAUDE.md`: `jira.enabled: true`)

### Dual Mode Behavior

**Local Mode (Jira Disabled - Default):**
- Epics: `pm/epics/EPIC-###-name.md` files
- Issues: `pm/issues/TASK-###/`, `BUG-###/` directories
- Fully offline, no external dependencies

**Jira Mode (Jira Enabled):**
- Epics: Created in Jira ONLY (PROJ-100, PROJ-200)
- No local epic files: `pm/epics/` remains empty
- Issues: Hybrid - Jira (PROJ-###) or local exploration (TASK-###, BUG-###)
- Local directories: `pm/issues/PROJ-###-name/` for PLAN.md, WORKLOG.md, RESEARCH.md

### Jira Epic Creation

**Field Discovery:**
1. Check cache: `.ai-toolkit/jira-field-cache.json`
2. If missing: Fetch field metadata from Jira
3. Parse required fields + allowed values
4. Cache for 7 days

**Conversational Collection:**
- Standard fields: Summary, Description
- Custom required fields: Prompt with field name + options
- Example: "Your Jira requires 'Team' field. Which team? (Frontend/Backend/DevOps)"

**Create in Jira:**
- Use Atlassian Remote MCP
- Get epic ID: PROJ-100
- Display Jira URL

### Jira Issue Creation

**Same field discovery + collection pattern as epics**

**Issue Type Mapping:**
- User Story → Jira Story
- Task → Jira Task
- Bug → Jira Bug

**Optional Local Directory:**
- Create `pm/issues/PROJ-###-name/` for:
  - `PLAN.md` - Implementation phases (AI-managed)
  - `WORKLOG.md` - Work history
  - `RESEARCH.md` - Technical deep dives
- NO `TASK.md` file (Jira is source of truth)

### Promotion Pattern

**Local → Jira Migration:**

When local exploration (TASK-###) is validated and ready for team:

1. `/promote TASK-001`
2. Read local TASK.md
3. Discover Jira fields
4. Create in Jira → Get PROJ-123
5. Migrate files:
   ```
   pm/issues/TASK-001-name/ → pm/issues/PROJ-123-name/
   ├── PLAN.md    (migrated)
   ├── WORKLOG.md (migrated)
   └── RESEARCH.md (migrated)
   ```
6. Update git branch: `feature/TASK-001` → `feature/PROJ-123`
7. Optional: Clean up original `TASK-001/` directory

See `/promote` command for detailed workflow.

## Naming Best Practices

### Epic Names

**Good Names** (clear capability focus):
- "User Authentication"
- "Payment Processing"
- "Admin Dashboard"
- "Search & Filtering"

**Avoid** (implementation details):
- "Add Login API Endpoints"
- "Build React Components"
- "Set Up Database"

### Task Names

**Good Names** (specific, actionable):
- "User Registration Form"
- "Password Reset Flow"
- "Email Verification System"
- "OAuth Integration"

**Avoid** (vague or overly technical):
- "User Stuff"
- "Fix Things"
- "Implement JWT Token Refresh Logic with Redis Cache"

**Sweet Spot:** Specific enough to understand, concise enough for file paths.

## Status Management

### Epic Status Values

- `planning` - Epic defined, tasks not yet created or planned
- `in_progress` - At least one task started
- `completed` - All tasks complete, DoD satisfied
- `on_hold` - Blocked or deprioritized

**Status Updates:**
- Manual updates by team
- Or: Infer from task status (all tasks complete → epic complete)

### Issue Status Values

- `todo` - Created, not started
- `in_progress` - Implementation underway
- `completed` - All acceptance criteria met
- `blocked` - Waiting on dependency or decision

**Status Updates:**
- `/implement` can update status automatically
- Or: Manual updates in issue frontmatter

## Integration with Development Workflow

**Epic/Issue Management Fits into Overall Workflow:**

```
1. /project-brief          → Define product vision
2. /epic                   → Break down into epics
3. /epic (refinement)      → Add tasks to epics
4. /plan TASK-###          → Create implementation plan
5. /implement TASK-### 1.1 → Execute phases
6. /commit                 → Create commits
7. /branch merge           → Merge to staging/production
```

**Key Relationships:**
- Epic → Tasks (one-to-many)
- Task → Plan (one-to-one, created by `/plan`)
- Task → Worklog (one-to-one, created by `/implement`)
- Epic → ADRs (many-to-many via Dependencies)

## Customization

### Adding Custom Issue Types

1. **Create Template:** `pm/templates/spike.md`
2. **Update Configuration:** Add to `issue_types` in YAML frontmatter above
3. **Use in Workflow:** `/epic` will automatically support new type

**Example Custom Type:**
```yaml
issue_types:
  spike:
    prefix: "SPIKE"
    template: "pm/templates/spike.md"
    description: "Time-boxed research and investigation"
```

### Modifying Epic Structure

1. **Update Template:** `pm/templates/epic.md`
2. **Update Configuration:** Modify `epic_sections` in YAML frontmatter
3. Commands adapt automatically

### Adjusting Recommended Sizes

**In YAML frontmatter above, modify:**
```yaml
epic_breakdown:
  recommended_size: "3-10 tasks"     # Your team's preference
  max_size_warning: 15               # Higher threshold
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Feature Epic with Phased Delivery

```
EPIC-001: "Payment Processing"

Phase 1 (MVP):
- TASK-001: Credit Card Processing (Stripe)
- TASK-002: Basic Payment Form
- TASK-003: Receipt Generation

Phase 2 (Enhancements):
- TASK-004: PayPal Integration
- TASK-005: Saved Payment Methods
- TASK-006: Refund Processing
```

**Approach:** Create all tasks upfront, mark MVP tasks as higher priority.

### Pattern: Bug Fix Epic

```
EPIC-002: "Session Management Improvements"

- BUG-001: Session Timeout Not Working
- BUG-002: Session Cookies Not Secure
- TASK-007: Add Session Monitoring
- TASK-008: Session Cleanup Cron Job
```

**Approach:** Mix bugs and improvement tasks in single epic.

### Pattern: Spike Before Implementation

```
EPIC-003: "Real-time Notifications"

1. SPIKE-001: Research WebSocket vs SSE
2. SPIKE-002: Evaluate Pusher vs self-hosted
3. TASK-009: Implement chosen solution
```

**Approach:** Research tasks before implementation tasks.
