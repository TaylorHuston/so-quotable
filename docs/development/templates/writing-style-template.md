# Writing Style Guide

**Optional template** for projects with content and copywriting needs. Defines voice, tone, and writing conventions for user-facing text.

## Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice

[Define your brand's writing personality - typically 3-5 characteristics]

Example:
- **Clear & Concise**: Simple language, avoid jargon
- **Friendly but Professional**: Conversational without being casual
- **Helpful**: Guide users, explain actions clearly
- **Positive**: Frame messages constructively
- **Confident**: Authoritative without being arrogant

### Tone by Context

Adjust tone based on user context:

```yaml
Onboarding:
  tone: "Welcoming, encouraging, patient"
  example: "Welcome! Let's get you set up in just a few steps."

Error Messages:
  tone: "Apologetic, helpful, solution-focused"
  example: "We couldn't save your changes. Please check your internet connection and try again."

Success Messages:
  tone: "Celebratory, affirming"
  example: "Perfect! Your project is live."

Empty States:
  tone: "Motivating, guiding"
  example: "No projects yet. Create your first project to get started."

Settings/Technical:
  tone: "Direct, informative, precise"
  example: "Enable notifications to stay updated on project activity."
```

## Microcopy Guidelines

### Buttons & CTAs

```yaml
Principles:
  - Use verb-first labels ("Save Changes" not "Click to Save")
  - Be specific ("Delete Account" not "Confirm")
  - Keep under 3 words when possible
  - Action-oriented language

Examples:
  Primary Actions: "Create Project", "Save Changes", "Send Message"
  Secondary Actions: "Cancel", "Go Back", "Skip"
  Destructive Actions: "Delete Account", "Remove File", "Clear All"

Avoid:
  - Generic labels: "OK", "Submit", "Click Here"
  - Passive voice: "Changes will be saved"
  - Redundancy: "Click to save" (button context implies clicking)
```

### Form Labels & Help Text

```yaml
Labels:
  - Clear and descriptive
  - Sentence case
  - No punctuation (unless question)
  - Examples: "Email address", "Project name", "Payment method"

Help Text:
  - Explain format or requirements
  - Appear below input field
  - Gray text, smaller font
  - Examples:
    - "We'll never share your email"
    - "Choose a unique name for your project"
    - "Must be at least 8 characters"

Placeholder Text:
  - Show format examples only
  - Don't repeat label text
  - Examples:
    - Email: "name@company.com"
    - Phone: "(555) 123-4567"
    - URL: "https://example.com"

Avoid placeholders as labels:
  - Bad: Placeholder "Enter your email" with no label
  - Good: Label "Email address" with placeholder "name@company.com"
```

### Error Messages

```yaml
Structure:
  1. What went wrong (specific)
  2. Why it happened (if helpful)
  3. How to fix it (actionable)

Examples:
  Good: "Email address is required. Please enter your email to continue."
  Bad: "Error: Field validation failed"

  Good: "Password must be at least 8 characters. Add 3 more characters."
  Bad: "Invalid password"

  Good: "This username is taken. Try adding numbers or your name."
  Bad: "Username exists"

Tone:
  - Never blame the user
  - Avoid technical jargon
  - Be constructive, not just descriptive
  - Use "Please" for requests
```

### Success Messages

```yaml
Principles:
  - Confirm what was accomplished
  - Be specific about the action
  - Positive but not overly enthusiastic

Examples:
  - "Project created successfully"
  - "Changes saved"
  - "Password updated"
  - "Invitation sent to team@company.com"

Avoid:
  - Vague: "Success!"
  - Overly enthusiastic: "Woohoo! You did it! Amazing!"
  - Technical: "Database record updated"
```

### Empty States

```yaml
Structure:
  1. Explain why it's empty
  2. Suggest next action
  3. Optionally provide context/benefit

Examples:
  Good:
    "No projects yet. Create your first project to start collaborating with your team."

  Bad:
    "No data available"

Components:
  - Heading: State what's empty
  - Description: Brief explanation
  - CTA: Clear action button
  - Optional: Illustration or icon
```

### Loading & Progress

```yaml
Short waits (< 2 seconds):
  - Show spinner, no text
  - Or: "Loading..."

Medium waits (2-10 seconds):
  - Specific text: "Uploading files...", "Processing payment..."
  - Progress indicator if possible

Long operations (> 10 seconds):
  - Specific stages: "Analyzing data... (Step 2 of 3)"
  - Estimated time when possible: "About 30 seconds remaining"
  - Keep user informed of progress
```

## Capitalization & Formatting

### Capitalization Rules

```yaml
Headings:
  style: "Sentence case"
  examples:
    - "Create new project"
    - "Account settings"
    - "Billing and payments"
  avoid:
    - "Create New Project" (title case)
    - "ACCOUNT SETTINGS" (all caps)

Buttons:
  style: "Sentence case for multi-word, title case for single"
  examples:
    - "Save changes" (multi-word, sentence case)
    - "Cancel" (single word)
    - "Delete" (single word)

Navigation:
  style: "Sentence case"
  examples:
    - "Dashboard"
    - "Team settings"
    - "Billing history"

Labels:
  style: "Sentence case"
  examples:
    - "Email address"
    - "Project name"
    - "Payment method"

Acronyms:
  style: "All caps"
  examples: "API", "URL", "JSON", "PDF", "HTML"
```

### Numbers & Lists

```yaml
Numbers:
  - Use numerals: "3 items" not "three items"
  - Spell out: "one-time setup" (qualitative)
  - Large numbers: "1.5 million" or "1,500,000"

Lists:
  - Parallel structure (all start with verbs or all nouns)
  - Complete sentences end with period
  - Fragments don't end with period
  - Capitalize first word consistently

Dates & Times:
  - Format: "Jan 15, 2025" or "January 15, 2025"
  - Time: "3:00 PM EST" or "15:00"
  - Relative: "2 hours ago", "Just now", "Yesterday"
```

### Punctuation

```yaml
Periods:
  - Use in complete sentences
  - Skip in headings, labels, buttons
  - Skip in single-sentence help text under inputs

Exclamation Points:
  - Use sparingly
  - Only for genuine excitement or celebration
  - Never in error messages

Question Marks:
  - Use in questions to users
  - Example: "Delete this project?"

Commas:
  - Oxford comma: Yes
  - Example: "projects, files, and settings"
```

## Grammar & Usage

### Contractions

```yaml
Use: Yes (makes tone friendlier)

Examples:
  - "We'll send you a confirmation"
  - "You're all set"
  - "Couldn't save changes"

Avoid in:
  - Legal or financial contexts
  - Error messages (can sound flippant)
```

### Active vs. Passive Voice

```yaml
Prefer Active:
  - Active: "Save your changes before leaving"
  - Passive: "Changes should be saved before leaving"

Use Passive When:
  - Focusing on action, not actor
  - Example: "Your file was uploaded" (focus on file)
```

### Person & Point of View

```yaml
Use "You" for Users:
  - "Your projects"
  - "You have 3 notifications"

Use "We" for the Product/Company:
  - "We'll send you an email"
  - "We couldn't process your request"

Avoid Third Person:
  - Don't: "The user must enter their email"
  - Do: "Enter your email"
```

## Content Types

### Tooltips

```yaml
Purpose: Provide brief, contextual help

Guidelines:
  - Keep to 1-2 short sentences
  - Explain what, not why
  - Don't repeat visible text
  - Triggered on hover, not click

Examples:
  - Icon tooltip: "Export to CSV"
  - Feature tooltip: "Enable this to receive email notifications"
```

### Confirmation Dialogs

```yaml
Structure:
  1. Clear question
  2. Explain consequences (if destructive)
  3. Action buttons (confirm + cancel)

Examples:
  Destructive action:
    Title: "Delete project?"
    Body: "This will permanently delete 'Project Name' and all its files. This cannot be undone."
    Buttons: "Delete" (destructive) + "Cancel"

  Non-destructive:
    Title: "Leave without saving?"
    Body: "Your changes will be lost."
    Buttons: "Leave" + "Stay"
```

### Notifications

```yaml
Toast Notifications:
  - Brief: 1 sentence maximum
  - Auto-dismiss after 3-5 seconds
  - Examples:
    - "File uploaded"
    - "Link copied to clipboard"
    - "Settings saved"

Alert Banners:
  - More detail than toasts
  - User-dismissible
  - Persist until acknowledged
  - Examples:
    - "Your trial ends in 3 days. Upgrade to continue using premium features."
```

## Accessibility

### Screen Reader Considerations

```yaml
Alt Text:
  - Describe image content and function
  - Skip decorative images (alt="")
  - Keep concise but informative

ARIA Labels:
  - Provide context for icon-only buttons
  - Example: <button aria-label="Close dialog">×</button>
  - Announce dynamic content changes

Landmarks:
  - Use semantic HTML (nav, main, aside)
  - Label multiple instances: <nav aria-label="Main navigation">
```

### Plain Language

```yaml
Principles:
  - Use common words
  - Short sentences (< 20 words average)
  - Active voice
  - Avoid jargon and technical terms
  - Define acronyms on first use

Reading Level:
  - Target: 8th grade reading level
  - Tool: Hemingway Editor, Grammarly readability
```
