# Spike Workflow

**Referenced by:** `/issue`, `/plan`, `/implement`, `/complete`

Time-boxed exploration to answer "Can we?" or "Which approach?" questions.

---

## When to Use

| Situation | Workflow | Why |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Technical approach uncertain | **SPIKE** | Compare before committing |
| Comparing 2+ alternatives | **SPIKE** | Real prototypes, real data |
| Clear requirements, can write tests | TASK | TDD ensures quality |
| Something is broken | BUG | Different phase structure |

**Decision Rule:** Don't know what to build or how? → SPIKE. Know what to build? → TASK.

**Use Spike When:**
- Technical approach uncertain ("GraphQL or REST?")
- Comparing alternatives ("Library A vs B")
- Feasibility unknown ("Can we integrate with X?")
- Learning new technology before production use

**Don't Use Spike When:**
- Approach clear from requirements
- Team has done similar work before
- Uncertainty is in requirements (use `/spec`)

---

## Workflow Overview

```
/issue "question" → SPIKE.md (numeric ID, e.g., 003)
/plan ### → PLAN-1.md, PLAN-2.md (asks how many approaches)
/implement ### → Creates spike branch, explores approach
/complete ### → Pulls WORKLOGs, generates summary, cleans up
```

---

## Phase Structure

**Each approach is explored on its own branch:**

### 1. Create Spike
- `/issue "GraphQL vs REST?"` creates SPIKE.md
- Define questions to answer, time box, success criteria

### 2. Plan Approaches
- `/plan ###` asks how many approaches
- Creates PLAN-1.md, PLAN-2.md, etc.

### 3. Execute Exploration
- `/implement ###` asks which plan
- Creates `spike/###/plan-N` branch
- Work happens on spike branch with real commits
- WORKLOG-N.md tracks findings

### 4. Complete
- `/complete ###` pulls WORKLOGs to develop
- Generates SPIKE-SUMMARY.md with recommendation
- Prompts for follow-up (ADR, tasks, spec update)
- Optionally deletes spike branches

---

## Branching Model

```
develop
├── spike/003/plan-1    # GraphQL exploration
└── spike/003/plan-2    # REST exploration
```

**Key points:**
- Each approach is completely isolated
- Real dependencies, builds, tests
- Commits are allowed (real exploration)
- Branches never merge to develop
- Easy comparison: `git diff spike/003/plan-1..spike/003/plan-2`

---

## Quality Gates

**Spikes have different gates than TASK/BUG:**

- ✅ Time box respected (must end)
- ✅ Questions answered (or documented as unanswerable)
- ✅ Findings documented in WORKLOG
- ✅ Recommendation made
- ❌ TDD not required (exploratory code)
- ❌ Code review not required (throwaway prototypes)

## File Structure

```
# On develop (permanent)
pm/issues/003-graphql-vs-rest/
├── SPIKE.md              # Questions, time box, criteria
├── PLAN-1.md             # GraphQL approach
├── PLAN-2.md             # REST approach
├── WORKLOG-1.md          # Pulled from spike branch
├── WORKLOG-2.md          # Pulled from spike branch
└── SPIKE-SUMMARY.md      # Generated by /complete

# On spike branch (temporary)
spike/003/plan-1/
├── [exploration code]
└── pm/issues/003-*/WORKLOG-1.md
```

---

## WORKLOG

Track discoveries on spike branch in WORKLOG-N.md. Use **Standard format** with time tracking.

**Key addition for spikes**: Include `**Time spent**: Xh (Yh remaining)` in each entry.

See `worklog-format.md` for all entry formats and examples.

---

## Completion

**`/complete ###` performs:**

1. Switch to develop branch
2. Pull WORKLOG files from spike branches
3. Generate SPIKE-SUMMARY.md with recommendation
4. Commit documentation to develop
5. Prompt: Create ADR? Update spec? Create tasks?
6. Prompt: Delete spike branches?

**SPIKE-SUMMARY.md includes:**
- Executive summary with recommendation
- Questions answered
- Comparison table
- Next steps

---

## Best Practices

**Time Boxing:**
- Set realistic limits (4-8 hours typical)
- Track time in WORKLOG
- Must end even if questions unanswered

**Branch Hygiene:**
- Consistent naming: `spike/{###}/plan-N`
- Delete after completion unless valuable reference

**Documentation:**
- Document findings as you go
- Note surprises and gotchas immediately
- Include benchmark data

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Analysis paralysis | Strict time box |
| Building production code | Remember: exploratory, may be discarded |
| Skipping documentation | Document in WORKLOG as you explore |
| No follow-up | Always create ADR, update specs |
