# Development Loop Guidelines

**Referenced by Commands:** `/implement`, `/plan`, `/quality`, `/troubleshoot`, `/worklog`

## Quick Reference

This guideline defines our AI-assisted development workflow, emphasizing test-first development, continuous code review, and agent coordination through WORKLOG entries.

**Core Cycle**: Write Tests → Implement → Run Tests → Code Review → Iterate until 90+ score and tests pass

## Our Development Philosophy

**Pragmatic Test-First**: Test-first is the default when you know what to build (clear acceptance criteria, defined behavior). Code-first is appropriate when exploring unknowns (prototypes, unclear requirements, architecture scaffolding). The goal is confidence, not dogma.

**When You Know What to Build** → Write tests first (Red-Green-Refactor)
**When You're Discovering** → Code first, add tests once the approach is validated

**Quality Over Speed**: Code review threshold of 90+ ensures maintainable, well-structured code. Take time to get it right.

**Agent Coordination**: Specialists document their work in WORKLOG for context continuity. Each agent reads WORKLOG before starting to understand what's been accomplished.

**Continuous Improvement**: Each iteration through the loop improves both the code and our understanding of the problem.

## The Development Loop

### 1. Start with Tests (When Applicable)

**Pragmatic Test-First Approach**: Choose the right tool for the job.

**✅ Test-First (Highly Preferred) - When you know what to build:**
- Feature has clear acceptance criteria from `/plan` output
- Phase objectives specify expected behavior
- Bug fix with reproducible failure scenario
- API endpoints or data transformations (clear inputs/outputs)
- Refactoring existing code (tests prevent regressions)

**📝 Code-First (Acceptable) - When discovering what to build:**
- Exploratory work or proof-of-concept (learning by doing)
- Architecture setup or scaffolding (establishing patterns)
- Initial project structure (no behavior to test yet)
- Unclear requirements that need discovery (spike first, then decide)
- Research tasks (document findings, then extract patterns)

**⚠️ Code-First Commitment**: If you code-first, **add tests before marking phase complete**. The development loop requires test coverage regardless of approach - the only difference is timing.

**Test-first process (Red-Green-Refactor):**
```bash
# Red: Write minimal failing tests that define success
# Verify tests fail for the right reason
# Green: Write minimal code to make tests pass
# Refactor: Improve code while tests stay green
```

### 2. Implement Minimal Code

Write only the code needed to pass the tests. Avoid:
- Gold-plating (features not in acceptance criteria)
- Premature optimization
- Speculative generalization
- Over-engineering

**Focus on:**
- Meeting acceptance criteria exactly
- Clear, readable code
- Proper error handling
- Following project coding standards

### 3. Run Tests

Execute full test suite appropriate for the phase:

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm test:unit         # Unit tests only
npm test:integration  # Integration tests
npm test:e2e          # End-to-end tests
```

**Test execution rules:**
- All relevant tests must pass before proceeding
- No skipping or commenting out failing tests
- Address test failures immediately
- Verify coverage meets target (95% by default)

See `testing-standards.md` for framework-specific commands and test organization.

### 4. Code Review Process

**Invoke code-reviewer agent** after implementation:

```bash
# Code reviewer evaluates:
- Code quality and maintainability
- Adherence to coding-standards.md
- Best practices for the tech stack
- Security considerations
- Performance implications
- Test coverage and quality
```

**Scoring criteria:**
- **90-100**: Excellent - ready to proceed
- **80-89**: Good - minor improvements needed
- **70-79**: Acceptable - moderate refactoring needed
- **Below 70**: Requires significant rework

**Threshold**: 90+ required to proceed (configurable above)

**WORKLOG Documentation** (MANDATORY):
- `code-reviewer` MUST write its own WORKLOG entry after EVERY review
- Use REVIEW APPROVED entry format (score ≥90) or REVIEW REQUIRES CHANGES (score <90)
- Implementation agents should NOT write review results in their entries
- Review entries document: score, strengths, issues found, files reviewed
- See `worklog-format.md` for complete Review entry formats and examples

**Why separate review entries matter**:
- Provides detailed feedback visible to future agents
- Documents what was reviewed and why it passed/failed
- Creates audit trail of quality decisions
- Helps future developers understand code quality evolution

See `coding-standards.md` for specific style and quality expectations.

### 5. Iterate Until Quality Gates Pass

**Quality gates** (all must pass):
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Code review score ≥ 90
- ✅ Test coverage ≥ 95% (or project target)
- ✅ No critical security issues
- ✅ Acceptance criteria met

**Iteration process:**
1. Address code review feedback
2. Refactor based on suggestions
3. Re-run tests
4. Request re-review if major changes
5. Repeat until all gates pass

### 6. Review and Adapt Plans (After Phase Completion)

**After completing each phase, conduct review cycle to adapt plans**:

**Step 1: Run Quality Reviews**
- Code review (always - via code-reviewer agent)
- Security audit (if security-critical flag set)
- Architecture review (if high complexity)

**Step 2: Synthesize Findings**
- Identify immediate actions vs deferred improvements
- Determine impact on remaining phases
- Make decisions (with stakeholder input if needed)

**Step 3: Adapt TASK and PLAN Files**
- Update TASK.md if new requirements discovered
- Update PLAN.md phases based on learnings
- Remove obsolete approaches from PLAN
- Keep files clean and current

**Step 4: Document in WORKLOG**
- Brief entry: what changed and why
- Link to detailed reports if needed
- See [worklog-format.md](worklog-format.md) for "Plan Changes" entry format

**Step 5: Proceed to Next Phase**
- With updated understanding
- With adapted approach
- With cleaner, more accurate plan

**Example review cycle**:
```
Phase 2 Complete → Security Audit → Finds email verification needed
→ Add to TASK.md acceptance criteria
→ Insert Phase 3 in PLAN.md for email verification
→ Document decision in WORKLOG.md
→ Proceed to new Phase 3
```

**Key principle**: Inspect and adapt - plans evolve based on implementation learnings.

## Agent Coordination

### Specialist Agent Selection

**Always call the most qualified agent** for the task:

- **backend-specialist**: Server-side logic, APIs, middleware
- **frontend-specialist**: UI components, user interactions, responsive design
- **database-specialist**: Schema design, queries, migrations, performance
- **devops-engineer**: Infrastructure, deployment, CI/CD
- **test-engineer**: Test strategy, test creation, test maintenance
- **security-auditor**: Security review, vulnerability assessment
- **performance-optimizer**: Performance analysis, optimization
- **code-reviewer**: Code quality assessment, best practices review
- **context-analyzer**: External research, documentation lookup, resource curation

### Agent Orchestration: Who Drives the Handoffs?

**The `/implement` command orchestrates all agent handoffs** following this pattern:

```
/implement TASK-### PHASE
  ↓
1. Command reads phase from PLAN.md
2. Command selects specialist based on phase domain
3. Specialist reads WORKLOG.md for context
4. Specialist executes phase following development loop
5. Specialist writes WORKLOG.md entry
6. Command invokes code-reviewer for quality check
7. If score < 90: Specialist iterates (back to step 4)
8. If score ≥ 90: Phase marked complete in PLAN.md
```

**Key points:**
- **Commands orchestrate, agents execute**: `/implement` decides which agent to invoke and when
- **Phase domain determines agent**: Backend phases → backend-specialist, frontend phases → frontend-specialist, etc.
- **WORKLOG.md enables handoffs**: Agents communicate through WORKLOG entries, not direct interaction
- **Iteration is command-driven**: `/implement` loops the specialist + code-reviewer cycle until quality gates pass

**Agent coordination metadata** (in agent YAML frontmatter):
```yaml
coordination:
  hands_off_to: [...]
  receives_from: [...]
  parallel_with: [...]
```

This metadata is **documentation only** - it helps humans understand typical agent relationships but is not read programmatically. The `/implement` command makes all orchestration decisions based on phase requirements, not this metadata.

### Agent Handoff Pattern in Practice

**Example: Implementing a backend phase**

```
User: /implement TASK-001 1.2

/implement command:
1. Reads TASK-001/PLAN.md → Phase 1.2: "Implement login endpoint"
2. Determines domain: backend → Selects backend-specialist
3. Invokes backend-specialist with phase context

backend-specialist:
4. Reads TASK-001/WORKLOG.md (sees phase 1.1 completed database setup)
5. Follows development loop: write tests → implement → run tests
6. Writes WORKLOG.md entry documenting login endpoint work (see Work Documentation section for format)

/implement command:
7. Invokes code-reviewer to assess implementation

code-reviewer:
8. Reviews code → Score: 85 ("Add input validation")

/implement command:
9. Score < 90 → Re-invokes backend-specialist with feedback

backend-specialist:
10. Addresses feedback, adds input validation
11. Re-runs tests
12. Updates WORKLOG.md entry

/implement command:
13. Re-invokes code-reviewer

code-reviewer:
14. Reviews code → Score: 92

/implement command:
15. Score ≥ 90 ✓ → Marks phase 1.2 complete
16. Updates TASK.md (checks off phase 1.2)
```

**Key insight**: The `/implement` command is the conductor - it reads, decides, invokes, validates, and loops. Agents are specialists that execute when invoked.

## Work Documentation

### File Purposes

Every issue directory (`pm/issues/TASK-###-name/` or `BUG-###-name/`) should contain at least 3 files:

**TASK.md / BUG.md** (WHAT to do):
- Primary issue file with acceptance criteria
- Created by `/spec` or `/plan` commands
- See `pm-guide.md` for complete format

**PLAN.md** (HOW to do it - phases):
- Phase-based implementation breakdown
- Created by `/plan` command
- See `pm-guide.md` for complete format

**WORKLOG.md** (WHAT was done and WHY):
- Reverse chronological narrative work history
- Documents work done, decisions made, and rationale
- Created automatically by `/implement` after each phase
- See `worklog-format.md` for entry formats (Standard, Troubleshooting, Investigation, Reviews)
- For complex architecture decisions, use `/adr` to create Architecture Decision Records

### WORKLOG Documentation

**For complete WORKLOG entry formats**, see `worklog-format.md` which documents:
- Standard format (HANDOFF, COMPLETE, and REVIEW entries)
- Troubleshooting format (hypothesis-based entries)
- Investigation format (external research findings)
- When to write entries vs when to skip
- Best practices and examples
- Entry length guidelines
- Cross-referencing RESEARCH.md

**Quick Reference:**
- Write entries at agent handoffs and phase completion
- Always maintain reverse chronological order (newest at TOP)
- Keep entries scannable (~500 chars ideal)
- Reference RESEARCH.md for complex decisions

### Troubleshooting

**When encountering bugs or unexpected behavior**, use the structured troubleshooting methodology.

**See**: `troubleshooting.md` for complete 5-step loop (Research → Hypothesize → Implement → Test → Document), debug logging practices, and troubleshooting-specific WORKLOG format.

**See**: `worklog-format.md` for troubleshooting WORKLOG entry format with hypothesis tracking.

**Command**: Use `/troubleshoot` to apply systematic debugging approach

### Architecture Decision Records

**For significant technical decisions**, use `/adr` command to create Architecture Decision Records:
- Architecture decisions affecting multiple components
- Technology selections with trade-offs
- Security approaches and threat models
- Performance strategies with benchmarks
- API design patterns and conventions

**Decision documentation guidelines:**
- **Simple decisions** → WORKLOG entry with brief rationale
- **External research** → Investigation format (invoke context-analyzer)
- **Architecture decisions** → ADR via `/adr` command
- **Complex debugging** → Extended WORKLOG entries with hypothesis tracking

## Test-First Strategy

### Benefits

- **Clarity**: Forces clear understanding of requirements before coding
- **Coverage**: Ensures all code is tested (no "I'll add tests later")
- **Design**: Better API design from thinking about usage first
- **Confidence**: Know immediately when code meets requirements
- **Regression**: Prevents future changes from breaking functionality

### When Test-First Applies

**Always for:**
- New features with defined acceptance criteria
- Bug fixes (write test that reproduces bug first)
- API endpoints and services
- Data transformations and business logic
- Critical user workflows

**Optional for:**
- Exploratory prototypes (add tests once approach is validated)
- Infrastructure setup (integration tests may be more appropriate)
- Configuration changes
- Documentation updates

### Test-First Example

```
Phase 1.2: Implement user registration endpoint

1. Write test:
   ✓ POST /api/register with valid data returns 201
   ✓ POST /api/register with duplicate email returns 409
   ✓ POST /api/register with invalid data returns 400
   ✓ POST /api/register creates user in database

2. Verify tests fail (red)

3. Implement endpoint (minimal code to pass)

4. Run tests (green)

5. Code review → Score: 85 (needs error handling improvement)

6. Refactor error handling

7. Re-run tests (still green)

8. Code review → Score: 92 (ready to proceed)

9. Write WORKLOG entry, proceed to next phase
```


## Quality Gates

**Quality gates are validation checkpoints** that ensure code quality at per-phase, per-task, and per-spec levels.

**For complete quality gate configuration and enforcement details**, see `quality-gates.md` which documents:
- Quality gate hierarchy (phase → task → spec)
- Customizing quality dimensions
- Complexity scoring system
- Per-phase, per-task, and per-spec gates
- Documentation synchronization checklist

**Quick Reference - Per-Phase Gates** (enforced by `/implement`):
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Code review score ≥ 90
- ✅ Test coverage ≥ 95% (or project target)
- ✅ No critical security issues
- ✅ Acceptance criteria met

**The quality-gates.md file is the single source of truth for gate configuration.**

4. Recommend improvements if below thresholds
```

See individual command documentation for complete workflows.

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Implementation

```
TASK-001 Phase 1.2: Implement login endpoint
→ Test-Engineer writes 4 tests (valid creds, invalid creds, token claims, rate limit)
→ Backend-Specialist implements endpoint + JWT + rate limiting
→ Tests pass, Code-Reviewer scores 88 (feedback: timing attack protection needed)
→ Refactor with constant-time comparison, re-test, score 93 ✅
→ WORKLOG entry, mark phase complete
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix

```
BUG-003: Cart total calculation incorrect
→ Test-Engineer writes failing test (expects $90, shows $100)
